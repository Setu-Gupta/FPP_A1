1. File struct
        * src contains the source file and the Makefile
        * debug contains the compiled shared object files which were compiled with the debug configuration
        * release contains the compiled shared object files which were compiled with the release configuration
        * tests contains the test codes

2. How to compile
        * Run make with the desired build type (release or debug)
                $ make -j < release | debug >

3. How to compile test cases
        * Export the path to the stamp library
                * export STAMP_PATH=$(pwd)/< release | debug >
        * Go to the tests directory
                $ cd tests
        * Run make with the desired build type (release or debug)
                $ make -j < release | debug >

4. How to run test cases
        * Complete steps 2 and 3 first
        * Go to the tests directory
                $ cd tests
        * Export the path to the build directories (release or debug) to the preload path and run the executable
                $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/this/directory/< release | debug >:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./name_of_the_executable

5. How to clean
        * Run make with clean
                $ make clean -j

Note: Running make with help will display the usage information of the Makefile
        * make help
