1. How to compile
        * Go to the library sub-directory
                $ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/library
        * Run make with the desired build type (release or debug)
                $ make -j < release | debug >

2. How to compile test cases
        * Export the path to the stamp library
                * export STAMP_PATH=$PROJECT_ROOT/library
        * Go to the examples directory
                $ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/examples
        * Run make with the desired build type (release or debug)
                $ make -j < release | debug >

3. How to run test cases
        * Complete steps 1 and 2 first
        * Go to the examples directory
                $ cd $PROJECT_ROOT/examples
        * Export the path to the library directory to the library preload path and run the executable
                $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PROJECT_ROOT/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./name_of_the_executable

4. How to clean
        * Run make with clean
                $ make clean -j

Notes:
        * Running make with help will display the usage information of the Makefile
                $ make help
        * PROJECT_ROOT is the submission directory
